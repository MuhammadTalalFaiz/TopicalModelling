# News Forensics using K-Means/DBSCAN Clustering and LDA/LSA Topic Modelling with the help of other NLP Techniques
 The aim of our project is to perform News Clustering focused on grouping news article headlines related to the same story and then to comprehensively group together stories that share a similar theme through Topic Modelling. By doing so we can look at the trends of how the popularity of certain topics have evolved over the years as well as predict what topic and news category headlines broadcast nowadays belong to as well as past news related to them. In simpler terms, we are performing a very rudimentary and primitive task of a much bigger idea that is News Forensics. Our project will make use of mainly unsupervised methods such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Topic Modelling and K-Means Clustering. We also plan on experimenting with Latent Semantic Analysis and depending on our needs Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise.
